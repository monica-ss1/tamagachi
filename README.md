# Tamagachi but Better
by Spencer Blunt, Monica Soliman, and Michelle Pineda
## How Does it Work?
This is a pet care game, it is meant to idle in the background of your phone with you taking care of the pet intermediately. Beware though! If you forget to care for your pet it will die!
## Features
You have three main abilities to interact with your pet:
1. Feed them
2. Bathe them
3. Love them

There is a save function so your stats will save even if you close the app. There is also the ability to restart if you would like.
## Technologies Used
SwiftUI — UI and layout
SpriteKit — Pet animation and movement
UserDefaults — Saving and loading stats
