## How Does it Work?
This is a pet care game, it is meant to idle in the background of your phone with you taking care of the pet intermediately. Beware though! If you forget to care for your pet it will die!
## Features
You have three main abilities to interact with your pet:
1. Feed them
2. Bathe them
3. Love them
There is a save function so your stats will save even if you close the app. There is also the ability to restart if you would like.
